\title{Calculate 3D covariance matrix}
\usage{
dotcvm(M)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{An N x 3 x M array. M = no of specimens, N = no of landmarks.}
}
\value{
N x N covariance matrix
}
\description{
Calculate 3D covariance matrix
}
\details{
This function does not guarantee that the returned matrix is  
 positive definite. If the covariance matrix is not positive definite 
 a warning is given and the matrix can be bent to create the closest
 positive definite matrix with \code{as.matrix(Matrix::nearPD(mat)$mat)}.
}
\examples{
M <- array(rnorm(4 * 2 * 3), dim = c(2, 3, 4)) 
M.cvm <- dotcvm(M)
}
